Welcome to Team Rock Lobster's Virtual Pet!
We made sure to make our game as accessible as possible with our simple to use interface. 
1. Once you run the program it will guide you to our "Welcome Screen" this is where you will enter:
START
or
Exit (this will immediatly close the game)
2. Once you Enter Start you will be greeted with a promt asking if you would like to:
Drop off a pet [Drop] - Here is where you can add CUSTOM VIRTUAL PETS to our Virtual Shelter. Includes custom name and Whether the pet is organic or robotic.
All you will need to do is follow the promts asking you about the pet you would like to drop.
Adopt a pet [Adopt] - If you would like to take one of our bundle of joys home with you here is where you do it!
When you select the ADOPT option you will receive a list of our avaliable pets. You type the name of the Pet you would like to take home and BOOM DONE!
Visit a pet or all pets [Visit]  - When you type Visit option you will get a list of 12 actions to interat with our pets.
To select which option you would like and type the number associated with it I.e. 1,2,3,...
After every action you take you the game will take you back to the DROP, ADOPT, VISIT screen to continue playing as long as you would like.
