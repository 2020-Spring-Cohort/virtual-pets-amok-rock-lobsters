Welcome to Team Rock Lobster's Virtual Pet Application!

We made sure to make our game as accessible as possible with our simple to use interface.

1.Once you run the program, it will guide you to our "Welcome Screen". This is where you will enter:
START
or
Exit (this will immediately close the game)

2. Once you Enter Start, you will be greeted with a prompt asking if you would like to:
    *Drop off a pet [Drop] - Here is where you can add CUSTOM VIRTUAL PETS to our Virtual Shelter. Includes custom name
     and whether the pet is organic or robotic.
    -All you will need to do is follow the prompts asking you about the pet you would like to drop.

    *Adopt a pet [Adopt] - If you would like to take one of our bundles of joy home with you, here is where you do it!
    -When you select the ADOPT option, you will receive a list of our available pets. You type the name of the pet you
     would like to take home and BOOM DONE!

    *Visit a pet or all pets [Visit]  - When you type Visit option, you will get a list of 12 actions to interact with our pets.
    -To select which option you would like, type the number associated with it, i.e. 1,2,3,...
    -After every action you take, the game will take you back to the DROP, ADOPT, and VISIT screen to continue playing as long as you would like.
